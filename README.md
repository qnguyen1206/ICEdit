### 📢 Attention All: Incorrect ComfyUI Workflow Usage Alert!
- ### We have released our **[official ComfyUI workflow](#official-comfyui-workflow)** for proper usage! Check our repository and have a try!
- You need to **add the fixed pre-prompt "A diptych with two side-by-side images of the same scene. On the right, the scene is exactly the same as on the left but {instruction}"** before inputing the edit instructions, otherwise you may get bad results! (This is mentioned in the paper!, The code for the Hugging Face gradio demo already embeds this prompt. So, you can simply input the editing instructions without additional setup.)
- The width of the input image must resize to **512** (no restriction to height).
- Please **[use the Normal LoRA](https://huggingface.co/RiverZ/normal-lora/tree/main)** not the MoE-LoRA, because the MoE-LoRA cannot be correctly loaded with ComfyUI lora loader.
- 🔥💐🎆 Welcome to share your **creative workflows** (such as combining Redux, ACE, etc.) in the Issues section and showcase the results! We will include references so that more people can see your creativity.



# 💼 Installation

## Conda environment setup

```bash
conda create -n icedit python=3.10
conda activate icedit
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -U huggingface_hub
```

## Download pretrained weights

If you can connect to Huggingface, you don't need to download the weights. Otherwise, you need to download the weights to local.

- [Flux.1-fill-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/flux.1-fill-dev).
- [ICEdit-normal-LoRA](https://huggingface.co/RiverZ/normal-lora/tree/main).
- [ICEdit-MoE-LoRA](https://huggingface.co/sanaka87/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA/tree/main)

~~Note: Due to some cooperation permission issues, we have to withdraw the weights and codes of moe-lora temporarily. What is released currently is just the ordinary lora, but it still has powerful performance. If you urgently need the moe lora weights of the original text, please email the author.~~

## Inference in bash (w/o VLM Inference-time Scaling)

Now you can have a try!

> Our model can **only edit images with a width of 512 pixels** (there is no restriction on the height). If you pass in an image with a width other than 512 pixels, the model will automatically resize it to 512 pixels.

> If you found the model failed to generate the expected results, please try to change the `--seed` parameter. Inference-time Scaling with VLM can help much to improve the results.

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --seed 304897401 \
```

Editing a 512×768 image requires 35 GB of GPU memory. If you need to run on a system with 24 GB of GPU memory (for example, an NVIDIA RTX3090), you can add the `--enable-model-cpu-offload` parameter.

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --enable-model-cpu-offload
```

If you have downloaded the pretrained weights locally, please pass the parameters during inference, as in: 

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev \
                            --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-normal-LoRA
```

#### For the usage of MoE-LoRA version
```bash
python scripts/inference_moe.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --seed 42 \
```

```bash
python scripts/inference_moe.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --enable-model-cpu-offload
```

```bash
python scripts/inference_moe.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev \
                            --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA
```

## Inference in Gradio Demo

We provide a gradio demo for you to edit images in a more user-friendly way. You can run the following command to start the demo.

```bash
python scripts/gradio_demo.py --port 7860



## for MoE version
python scripts/gradio_demo_moe.py --port 7860

```

Like the inference script, if you want to run the demo on a system with 24 GB of GPU memory, you can add the `--enable-model-cpu-offload` parameter. And if you have downloaded the pretrained weights locally, please pass the parameters during inference, as in:

```bash
python scripts/gradio_demo.py --port 7860 \
                              --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev (optional) \
                              --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-normal-LoRA (optional) \
                              --enable-model-cpu-offload (optional) \

## for MoE version
python scripts/gradio_demo_moe.py --port 7860 \
                              --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev (optional) \
                              --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-normal-LoRA (optional) \
                              --enable-model-cpu-offload (optional) \
```

Or if you want to run the demo on a system with 10 GB of GPU memory, you can download the gguf models from [FLUX.1-Fill-dev-gguf](https://huggingface.co/YarvixPA/FLUX.1-Fill-dev-gguf), [t5-v1_1-xxl-encoder-gguf](https://huggingface.co/city96/t5-v1_1-xxl-encoder-gguf) and pass the parameters during inference, as in:

```bash
python scripts/gradio_demo.py --port 7861 \
                              --flux-path models/flux.1-fill-dev \
                              --lora-path models/ICEdit-normal-LoRA \
                              --transformer models/flux1-fill-dev-Q4_0.gguf \
                              --text_encoder_2 models/t5-v1_1-xxl-encoder-Q8_0.gguf \
                              --enable-model-cpu-offload \
```

Then you can open the link in your browser to edit images.

# 🔧 Training

Found more details in here: [Training Code](./train/)


# 🎨ComfyUI Workflow


### Official ComfyUI-workflow
We have released our **official ComfyUI workflow** in this repository for correct usage of our model! **We have embedded the prompt "A diptych with two side-by-side images of the same scene ... but" into our nodes** and you just need to input the edit instructions such as "make the girl wear pink sunglasses". We also add a high resolution refinement module for better image quality! The total VRAM consumption is about 14GB. Use this [workflow](https://github.com/hayd-zju/ICEdit-ComfyUI-official) and the [ICEdit-normal-lora](https://huggingface.co/RiverZ/normal-lora/tree/main) to fulfill your creative ideas!

We have specially created [a repository for the workflow](https://github.com/hayd-zju/ICEdit-ComfyUI-official) and you can **install it directly in ComfyUI**. Just open the manager tab and click **'Install via Git URL'**, copy the following URL and you are able to use it. For more details please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/River-Zhang/ICEdit/issues/22#issuecomment-2864977880)

**URL:** [https://github.com/hayd-zju/ICEdit-ComfyUI-official](https://github.com/hayd-zju/ICEdit-ComfyUI-official)

### ComfyUI-workflow for increased editing success rate
Thanks to [T8star](https://x.com/T8star_Aix)! He made a tutorial ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6GMKL-Jjos) and [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11HVhz1Eky/?spm_id_from=333.40164.top_right_bar_window_dynamic.content.click&vd_source=2a911c0bc75f6d9b9d056bf0e7410d45)) and a creative workflow ([OpenArt](https://openart.ai/workflows/t8star/icedit100v1/HN4EZ2Cej98ZX8CC1RK5) and [RunningHub](https://www.runninghub.cn/post/1920075398585974786/?utm_source=kol01-RH099)) that could increase the editing success rate greatly (about 100%)! Have a try with it!

<img src="docs/images/workflow_t8.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">


### ComfyUI-nunchaku

We extend our heartfelt thanks to @[judian17](https://github.com/judian17) for crafting a ComfyUI [workflow](https://github.com/River-Zhang/ICEdit/issues/1#issuecomment-2846568411) that facilitates seamless usage of our model. Explore this excellent [workflow](https://github.com/River-Zhang/ICEdit/issues/1#issuecomment-2846568411) to effortlessly run our model within ComfyUI. Only **4GB VRAM GPU** is enough to run with ComfyUI-nunchaku! 

This workflow incorporates high-definition refinement, yielding remarkably good results. Moreover, integrating this LoRA with Redux enables outfit changes to a certain degree. Once again, a huge thank you to @[judian17](https://github.com/judian17) for his innovative contributions!

# ⚠️ Tips

### If you encounter such a failure case, please **try again with a different seed**!

- Our base model, FLUX, does not inherently support a wide range of styles, so a large portion of our dataset involves style transfer. As a result, the model **may sometimes inexplicably change your artistic style**.

- Our training dataset is **mostly targeted at realistic images**. For non-realistic images, such as **anime** or **blurry pictures**, the success rate of the editing **drop and could potentially affect the final image quality**.

- While the success rates for adding objects, modifying color attributes, applying style transfer, and changing backgrounds are high, the success rate for object removal is relatively lower due to the low quality of the removal dataset we use.

The current model is the one used in the experiments in the paper, trained with only 4 A800 GPUs (total `batch_size` = 2 x 2 x 4 = 16). In the future, we will enhance the dataset, and do scale-up, finally release a more powerful model.

### ⚠️ Clarification

We've noticed numerous web pages related to ICEdit, including [https://icedit.net/](https://icedit.net/), [https://icedit.org/](https://icedit.org/). Kudos to those who built these pages!

However, we'd like to emphasize two important points:
- **No Commercial Use**: Our project **cannot** be used for commercial purposes. Please check the [LICENSE](https://github.com/River-Zhang/ICEdit/blob/main/LICENSE) for details.
- **Official Page**: The official project page is [https://river-zhang.github.io/ICEdit-gh-pages/](https://river-zhang.github.io/ICEdit-gh-pages/).
